  <h3>DISCLAIMER</h3>
  <p>This app would take alot of time to make but can be done.<br> Although publishing something like this has alot of legal requirements all depending on release areas.<br> I feel like this app would be great for data-mining due to peoples obsession with influencers and their internet popularity</p>
